## The brief

Choose [legacy code] (https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) (translated by Emily Bache) in the language of your choice. The aim is to practice good design in the language of your choice. Refactor the code in such a way that adding the new "conjured" functionality is easy.
